She coaches individuals to harness the current challenges in their lives by shifting into a new way of thinking and relating to oneself that leads to true freedom.
 </br></br>
“You can start exactly where you are,” she states, “and start to change the way you think. That is the first step to living an authentic expression of your true self.”
 </br></br>
As recent as 2012, she had been living a seemingly fantastic life full of great friends, success in school, and an indulgent Southern California university adventure. She had grown up in Taiwan, attending an American school, so she had adopted very Asian upper middle class beliefs. Through this perspective, it seemed she was doing a great job at what she was always meant to be doing!
 </br></br>
“I was the cool kid on the block – the bartender from Taipei. I got into a program to study under the best professors. Everything seemed perfect.”
 </br></br>

However, she did not have the awareness at the time that her life was not an expression of her true self. The only thing “missing” at that time was a positive relationship. It would be through relationships where she would come to realize the truth: how much she was hiding, how unwilling to be vulnerable she was, and how unfulfilled and dissatisfied she truly felt.
 </br></br>
  <quote><h2 style="float:left;max-width:50%;text-align:center;padding-right:5px;padding-top:5px;padding-bottom:5px"><b>"There was nothing to blame - just awareness to shift"</b>
	   </h2></quote>
	   <p>
She will never forget the day her life completely changed – the day she finally saw (through an all-important boy) that she was never going to have the relationship she desired through the consciousness she was in. She then began heeding the inner call, committing herself fully to change.
 </br></br>

 “I immersed myself into personal development, I started investing everything into myself and my transformation,” she recalls. “I cried a lot, but I knew that if I committed to letting go and changing the way I thought, I would come to love myself and express that in my life.”
 </br></br>
Within eight months, while in Milan, she had a life altering experience. “I came to know who I really was, that there was nothing to blame – no victims, no perpetrators – just awareness to shift, and that life was always unfolding perfectly for me to realize this.” Two weeks later, she manifested a positive relationship with a loving Italian man. 
 </br></br>
Today, she powerfully assists individuals like her who feel unfulfilled in life. She believes strongly that everyone can feel fulfilled and on purpose in whatever career path, and experience ease in relationships through authentically expressing the self.
 </br></br>
“I never knew a different way of life was available to me, but now, it's my second nature. It's my powerful knowing that if it can happen for me, it can happen for anyone.”
