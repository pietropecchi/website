Her coaching is about harnessing the current challenges and trials in her clients’ lives to shift into a new way of thinking and relating to oneself that leads to true freedom. She focuses on changing the way people think about things, providing her clients with not just what they should think, but instead, teaching them how to think, which allows the space for change to really take place in one’s life.</br>
 </br>
“You can start exactly where you are,” she states, “and start to change the way you think, because that is the first step on the journey of living a more authentic expression of your true self.”</br>
 </br>
As recent as 2012, she had been living a seemingly fantastic life full of great friends, success in school, and a typical indulgent Southern California university adventure. She had grown up in Taiwan in an American school, so she had a Western education, but she had very indoctrinated hereditary Asian upper middle class thought patterns. Through this perspective, it seemed she was doing what she was always meant to be doing, and was doing a great job at it, too!</br>
 </br>
“I was partying a lot, I was a cool kid on the block with killer bartending skills from my time working as a bartender in Taipei. I had also just gotten into a fantastic program at Uni with the opportunity to study under the best professors, so everything seemed to be perfect.”</br>
 </br>
  
  
  
  
 
However, she did not have the awareness at the time that her life was not an expression of her true self. The only thing “obviously missing” at that time in her life was a positive relationship, and it would be through that where she would come to realize her personal truth at the time: how much she was hiding, how unwilling to be vulnerable she was, and how unfulfilled she truly felt.</br>
 </br>

  <quote><h2 style="float:left;max-width:30%;text-align:center;padding-right:10px;padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px"><b>"I completely absorbed into myself a new way of thinking that was completely the opposite of everything I had ever been taught, which allowed me to express my full potential." </b></h2></quote>
  
She will never forget the day her life completely changed – the day she finally saw (through an all-important boy) that she was never going to get the relationship she desired through the consciousness she was in. As Albert Einstein stated, “Problems cannot be solved by the same level of awareness that created them.” She then began her journey of heeding the call, committing herself to full change.</br>
 </br>
“I immersed myself into personal development, I started investing in myself and my transformation, with what I had at the time. I constantly studied and realized so many things I didn’t know about myself,” she recalls. “And let’s not forget that I was crying almost every day for a few months after the life-changing incident I experienced. It was anything but easy, yet I also knew at the same time that if I committed to letting go of who I thought I was and changed the way I thought, then I would come to love my true self and begin to express that in my life.” </br>
 </br>

 Within eight months, while on a study abroad semester in Milan, Italy, she came to realize the truth and had a life altering experience. “I came to realize who I was this whole time, and that there was nothing to blame – no victims, no perpetrators – just awareness to be shifted, and that life was and had always been always unfolding perfectly for me to realize this.” About two weeks later, she manifested her dream relationship with a wonderful Italian man who had dreamed of being with her his entire life. 
 </br> </br>  
Today, she has come to lead in her role as a transformational coach, assisting individuals like her who felt unfulfilled in life, yet not knowing what other consciousness to adopt. 
  </br> </br> 
“I didn’t even know what was possible for me,” she states, “until I completely absorbed into myself a new way of thinking that was completely the opposite of everything I had ever been taught, which allowed me to express my full potential.”
  </br> </br>
She coaches clients into a way of thinking and shifts that create a deeper level of fulfillment and a sense of true meaning and purpose. She believes strongly that everyone can feel fulfilled and on purpose in whatever career path they choose, and experience incredible ease in relationships through authentic expression of the self. 
  </br> </br>
“I never thought that this way of life was available to me, but now, it’s my second nature. Therefore, it’s my powerful knowing that if it can happen for me, it can happen for anyone.”
